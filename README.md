# OpenMath
As a Math major and enthusiast myself, I have decided to start a project to provide open source resources for Math enthusiasts to learn higher Mathematics. The project aims to range from single variable calculus to the frontiers. 
# Initiative 
Well, let me introduce myself a little bit. The idea of this project roots from my very young age, which I have developed a great interest in Mathematics but I have a really hard time finding resources to learn beyond the scope. Especially for a undergraduate levels, they are not as well documented and organised as high school maths. <br>
This is somehow discouraging for young minds which may not have the full experience on how to find resources for studying. So, why don't make it easier? <br>
When I started this project, I am a 14 year old undergraduate Year 1 student. I have a more thorough understanding of what is really "higher mathematics" I have often been interested to and I would like to encourage more interested people to learn here.

# The Curriculum
## MATH001PB: Single Variable Calculus (Proof-Based)
The very first course will introduce you to single variable calculus (which you may have already learnt before), but it is a very good revision and moreover introduce students to formal mathematical language and logic. We will have a later course focusing on set theory and logic. <br>
(This curriculum will expand as I make more materials. Please stay tuned.)
