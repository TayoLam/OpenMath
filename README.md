# OpenMath
As a Math major and enthusiast myself, I have decided to start a project to provide open source resources for Math enthusiasts to learn higher Mathematics. The project aims to range from single variable calculus to the frontiers. 
# Initiative 
Well, let me introduce myself a little bit. The idea of this project roots from my very young age, which I have developed a great interest in Mathematics but I have a really hard time finding resources to learn beyond the scope. Especially for a undergraduate levels, they are not as well documented and organised as high school maths. <br>
This is somehow discouraging for young minds which may not have the full experience on how to find resources for studying. So, why don't make it easier? <br>
When I started this project, I am a 14 year old undergraduate Year 1 student. I have a more thorough understanding of what is really "higher mathematics" I have often been interested to and I would like to encourage more interested people to learn here.
# The Curriculum
## MATH001PB: Single Variable Calculus (Proof-Based)
The very first course will introduce you to single variable calculus (which you may have already learnt before), but it is a very good revision and moreover introduce students to formal mathematical language and logic. We will have a later course focusing on set theory and logic. 

## MATH002PB: Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning (Proof-Based)
This is a good follow-up course to MATH001PB to study if you like the "style" of formal mathematics presented in the previous course, which is a very important part to research and further studies in mathematics. This course mainly includes set theory, logic and introduction to abstract objects. Most of the "proofs" in high school is actually algebraic computations that lead to a certain result. For some curriculums which do Euclidean geometry proofs, you will be more familiar with this perspective of thinking.
<hr>(This curriculum will expand as I make more materials. Please stay tuned.)
