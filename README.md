# OpenMath
OpenMath is a open source educational initiative for Mathematics enthusiasts to learn higher Mathematics. In the long run, this project aims to range from single variable calculus to the frontiers of mathematical research.

# The Curriculum
## MATH001PB: Single Variable Calculus (Proof-Based)
The very first course will introduce you to single variable calculus (which you may have already learnt before), but it is a very good revision and moreover introduce students to formal mathematical language and logic. We will have a later course focusing on set theory and logic. 

## MATH002PB: Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning (Proof-Based)
This is a good follow-up course to MATH001PB to study if you like the "style" of formal mathematics presented in the previous course, which is a very important part to research and further studies in mathematics. This course mainly includes set theory, logic and introduction to abstract objects. Most of the "proofs" in high school is actually algebraic computations that lead to a certain result. For some curriculums which do Euclidean geometry proofs, you will be more familiar with this perspective of thinking.

## MATH003PB: Calculus of Complex Variables (Proof-Based) 
## MATH101PB: Differential Equations (Proof-Based)
## MATH102PB: Algebra (Proof-Based)
