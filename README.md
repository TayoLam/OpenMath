# OpenMath
OpenMath is a open source educational initiative for Mathematics enthusiasts to learn higher Mathematics. In the long run, this project aims to range from single variable calculus to the frontiers of mathematical research.
# Initiative 
Let me introduce myself. The idea of this project roots from my very young age, which I have developed a great interest in Mathematics but I have a really hard time finding resources to learn beyond the scope. Especially for a undergraduate levels, they are not as well documented and organised as high school maths. Moreover, most curriculums available starts with pattern recognision, instead of logic and proof-based real mathematics. <br>
This is somehow discouraging for young minds which may not have the full experience on how to find resources for studying. So, why don't make it easier? <br>
When I started this project, I am a 14 year old undergraduate Year 1 student. I have a more thorough understanding of what is really "higher mathematics" I have often been interested to and I would like to encourage more interested people to learn here.
# The Curriculum
## MATH001PB: Single Variable Calculus (Proof-Based)
The very first course will introduce you to single variable calculus (which you may have already learnt before), but it is a very good revision and moreover introduce students to formal mathematical language and logic. We will have a later course focusing on set theory and logic. 

## MATH002PB: Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning (Proof-Based)
This is a good follow-up course to MATH001PB to study if you like the "style" of formal mathematics presented in the previous course, which is a very important part to research and further studies in mathematics. This course mainly includes set theory, logic and introduction to abstract objects. Most of the "proofs" in high school is actually algebraic computations that lead to a certain result. For some curriculums which do Euclidean geometry proofs, you will be more familiar with this perspective of thinking.

## MATH003PB: Calculus of Complex Variables (Proof-Based) 
## MATH101PB: Differential Equations (Proof-Based)
## MATH102PB: Algebra (Proof-Based)
